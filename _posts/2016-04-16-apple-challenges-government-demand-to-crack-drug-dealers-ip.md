  Apple has formally challenged the U.S. Department of Justice over another
  locked iPhone and the encrypted information it contains. Owned by an accused
  methamphetamine distributor in Brooklyn, the iPhone 5s is believed to contain
  evidence of a drug conspiracy, investigators said. The government claims that
  its technicians can't penetrate the locked iPhone and require Apple's help to
  get inside.
