      The mystical Truffala trees - made popular by Dr. Seuss via The Lorax -
      are not the only wondrous branchy forms that are worthy of storytelling
      fame. Professor Sam Van Aken of Syracuse University has artfully grafted a
      tree that may appear unremarkable until the spring, when it blossoms with
      fruits of 40 different varieties, creating a magical facade worthy of
      standing next to a mighty Truffala tree.
